# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-with-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic details using unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
# Mall Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers in a shopping mall based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. Using clustering algorithms like K-Means, we identify distinct customer groups to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Age**: Customer's age
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income in thousands of dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Customer's spending score assigned by the mall

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform statistical analysis and visualizations.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant attributes for clustering.
4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
5. **Visualization**: Display customer clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
6. **Insights & Conclusions**: Interpret the segments for business applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mall-customer-segmentation.git

## Results

The project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on spending behavior and demographics. The insights can help businesses target different customer segments with personalized marketing strategies.
